# Furniture and storage mods

Builds furnished with the pack's furniture mods (Handcrafted, Lucky's Cozy Home, CobbleFurnies, Beautify) when the
server has them, and Sophisticated Storage and Tom's Simple Storage as village storage. Part of Furnished homes and
modded storage (2.1), behind its expansion gate (`Expansions.M37`), which stays closed until the release that finishes
it. The plan is the design note `docs/design/M37.md`.

Roadmap items: 37.1, 37.2

## 1. What a player sees

Nothing yet: 37.1 adds the expansion's gate and its three switches, all off for players until 2.1, and 37.2 records
where every build's furniture is, which changes nothing in the world by itself. When it is
finished, a server with Handcrafted gets Handcrafted chairs round a Handcrafted table, fancy beds with nightstands and
shelves of crockery in its homes; Cozy Home adds sofas, clocks and lamps, CobbleFurnies Poké Ball chairs, Beautify
blinds, picture frames and candelabras; villagers sit on the chairs and sleep in the fancy beds. Without any of those
mods every build is exactly today's vanilla build. The Storehouse also reads Sophisticated chests and barrels of every
tier, and a Sophisticated controller or a Tom's inventory connector as one store for everything it links.

## 2. How it works

Each piece of furniture our builds draw in vanilla blocks becomes a furniture spot (its kind, facing, wood or colour
and blocks). When a build is planned, each spot becomes the piece of the first mod in `furnitureMods` that the server
has, found by block id in the registry; no class of any of those mods is used, so they stay optional. A spot whose
modded piece doesn't fit, or whose kind no installed mod makes, keeps its vanilla blocks. The full formats, the list
of kinds and each mod's block ids are in the design note.

**Furniture spots (37.2).** Each of our blueprints with furniture has a file beside it,
`data/aliveworkplace/blueprint_furniture/<blueprint>.json` (223 of them), listing its spots: kind, position, facing,
wood or colour, and the vanilla blocks of the piece. The blueprint generator (`tools/blueprints/furniture.py`) finds
the chairs (a stair seat facing a table), tables (a lone post, or a row of posts, with a cloth or plate on it, or a top
slab on a lone post) and beds in every finished drawing, and a drawing records other kinds itself
(`Build.furniture`); before writing, it checks each spot's blocks are the template's blocks there. A spot with no wood
of its own takes the wood most of the build is made of. The game reads the files at start-up and on `/reload`
(a datapack can add its own); a file with a mistake is logged with its path and skipped. A styled blueprint's spots are
its base's, with the style's swaps: a spruce chair in the Dark Oak style is a dark oak chair.

## 3. Switches

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `furnishedBuilds` | on from 2.1 | Builds use the installed furniture mods. Off: every build is the vanilla build |
| `furnitureMods` | handcrafted, cozyhome, cobblefurnies, beautify | The order mods are tried in for each piece (file only); trimmed and lower-cased, blanks and repeats dropped, an empty list means vanilla |
| `moddedStorageNetworks` | on from 2.1 | Controllers and connectors in the Storehouse count as one store. Off: each linked chest is its own store |

With M37's gate closed (every release before 2.1) a config file can't turn `furnishedBuilds` or
`moddedStorageNetworks` on, and the settings screen doesn't list them.

## 4. Saved data

Only the config file's three keys so far (spots are data files, not saved). Planned (37.3): each build site's chosen pieces, absent meaning vanilla, so
old saves load unchanged.

## 5. Items, blocks, jobs, commands

No new items, blocks or commands. Config text: `aliveworkplace.config.furnishedBuilds`,
`aliveworkplace.config.moddedStorageNetworks`.

## 6. Decisions

- Support goes by block and item ids, tags and data files only, never the mods' classes, so it is all core code with
  no `compat/` package; a piece is used when the registry has its id (ROADMAP Milestone 37).
- Beautify is last in the default order because it makes decorations only (design note M37).
- Lanes don't make review packages (sessions.md, 2026-10-04): the digest sends the design note as 37.1's package.

## 7. Known limits

- Only the gate, the switches and the spots exist so far; the modded furniture, seats and storage networks come with
  37.3 to 37.10.
- The generator finds only chairs, tables and beds by itself; couches, shelves, lamps and the rest are spots only where
  a drawing records them (37.4 and 37.5 draw the furnished rooms that way).
- Lucky's Cozy Home can't load in the dev runtime, so it is tested by the pack test only.

## 8. Proof

GameTests: `FurnishingConfigGameTests.furnitureModsKeepTheirOrderAndAreCleaned` (the default order, cleaning, an empty
and a missing list, the list off the screen and in the saved file), `FurnishingConfigGameTests.theM37GateHoldsItsSwitches`
(a player's file can't turn them on with the gate closed; with it open they obey the file), and
`ExpansionGateGameTests` (both switches in its gated lists). 37.2:
`FurnitureSpotGameTests.starterCottageSpotsAreWhereItsChairsAndTablesAre`,
`FurnitureSpotGameTests.everyShippedSpotMatchesItsTemplate`, `FurnitureSpotGameTests.aBrokenSpotsFileIsSkipped`,
`FurnitureSpotGameTests.aStyleCarriesTheSpotsOver`.
