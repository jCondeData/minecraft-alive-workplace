# The full check before release (ROADMAP 21.2)

Done in pieces by night runs; each piece lands with `land --keep-open`. Newest first.

## Pieces

### Ferry edges (night-1003-0845, 2026-10-03)
- **Leaving the game mid-ride**: `FerryEdgeGameTests.aPlayerWhoLeavesMidRideIsLanded` closes the player's connection
  20 ticks into a ride (the way quitting does) and checks they are landed by the far post, out of the boat, the boat
  gone and the ferryman back on his jetty. **Found B13**: the ride was ended from Fabric's DISCONNECT event, which fires
  from netty's `channelInactive` on the network thread when a client quits, so the teleport, boat and ferryman moves
  ran off the server thread. Fixed in B13 (a `PlayerList.remove` mixin ends the ride on the server thread before the
  save). Mutant check: with the mixin call removed the test fails ("left at ..., not by the far post").
- **A Travel Ticket between dimensions**: `FerryEdgeGameTests.aTicketToAnotherDimensionTakesYouThere` uses a ticket
  for a post in the Nether at an Overworld post: a boat ride, then the player is in the Nether by the post, standing
  on its floor, the post among the places they know, no boat left in the Overworld, the ferryman home. Passes.
- Already covered before this check: a ride boat left behind by a restart is taken away when it loads
  (`RidingSpecGameTests.aFerryBoatLeftByARestartIsTakenAway`); getting out early lands you
  (`aFerryPassengerWhoGetsOutEarlyLands`).

### Pack boot and soak (from the nightly workflow)
- Nightly run 36991976288 (2026-10-02, commit aeee531): full build, flake sweep, translation check, log audit, real
  modpack boot and performance soak all green.

### Old world opened with the new version (chat, 2026-10-02)
- A world saved by the real 0.137.0 jar on the Cobbleverse pack, with all 26 retired job blocks and their workers,
  opened with 0.138.0: 26/26 blocks, jobs and job sites kept, no errors from our mod (ROADMAP 21.4).

## Still to do
- An old world saved by 0.138.0 opened with the next version (at the release check).
- Performance with many homes (`PERF=true PLOTS=40 tools/packtest/run.sh`, or read the nightly soak's numbers).
- 20 mutants and a flake sweep over the whole suite, and the biggest gaps from `inventory.py`.
