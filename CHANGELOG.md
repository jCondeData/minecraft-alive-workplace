# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-26

### Added
- Blueprint Table: browse every blueprint on the server with its size and full materials list, and take a copy for a Blank Blueprint (craft paper + blue dye).
- Upload your own builds: put `.litematic` or `.schem` files (e.g. from Planet Minecraft) in your `blueprints` folder, pick one at the Blueprint Table and press Upload — it becomes a blueprint everyone on the server can use.
- Imports read Litematica files, WorldEdit/Sponge schematics (v1–v3) and vanilla structure files; old block names are upgraded automatically and blocks from missing mods are reported.
- `/workplace import` (ops) imports files dropped into `<world>/aliveworkplace/import/`.
- `workplaceAllowUploads` gamerule.

### Fixed
- The blueprint list no longer shows other mods' world-generation structures.
